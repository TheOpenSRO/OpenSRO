# BMT material format (JMXVBMT)

`.bmt` is the material format referenced by `.bsr` objects and `.bms` meshes by filename — see
[BSR_FORMAT.md](BSR_FORMAT.md) and [BMS_FORMAT.md](BMS_FORMAT.md). It defines one or more
"layers", each with ambient/diffuse/specular/emissive colors and (usually) a reference to a
`.ddj` texture by bare filename.

Unlike the other `JMXV*` formats, `.bmt` isn't a raw magic-prefixed binary blob at the file level
— the whole file (after a 4-byte header) is a standard **zlib stream**, which only decompresses to
something with a `JMXVBMT 0102` magic. Confirmed empirically (byte-level, black-box) against 4
real files, found not in any pk2 archive available in this client build, but in a loose,
unpacked server patch-data tree
(`.../SMC_Independent/.../patch_upload_temp/data/Prim/mtrl/avatar/*.bmt`). No decompiler output
is stored in this repo — only the resulting facts about the container format.

## File layout

| Offset | Size | Field |
|-------:|-----:|-------|
| 0x00 | 4 | `uint32`: decompressed size of everything after this field |
| 0x04 | ... | A zlib stream (standard `zlib.NewReader`-compatible), decompressing to exactly the byte count above |

## Decompressed layout

| Field | Encoding |
|---|---|
| Magic | `"JMXVBMT 0102"` (12 bytes) |
| Layer count | `uint32` |
| Layers | that many layer records, back-to-back (see below) |

## Layer record

| Field | Encoding |
|---|---|
| Name | `uint32` length + ASCII bytes (e.g. `"avatar_m_zombie"`, or a generic `"Material #88"` — some layers are unnamed/default) |
| Ambient | 4× `float32` (RGBA) |
| Diffuse | 4× `float32` (RGBA) |
| Specular | 4× `float32` (RGBA) |
| Emissive | 4× `float32` (RGBA) |
| Power | `float32`, unconfirmed meaning (observed constant `0.0` in every real layer checked — plausibly specular power/shininess, never actually populated in these samples) |
| Unknown | `uint32`, unconfirmed meaning (observed values 64, 321, 832, 833 — not obviously a flags bitmask or a length) |
| Texture path | `uint32` length + ASCII bytes — a **bare filename**, not a path (e.g. `"avatar_m_zombie.ddj"`), resolved against whatever directory the `.bmt` itself lives in. Some layers have no texture (`length` reads as a small value pointing at unrelated data, or the layer is otherwise a pure color/tint layer) — treat a texture-read failure on validation as "no texture" rather than a hard error only when it's clearly not a real string |

Real layers were seen to share the exact same default color set (`ambient=diffuse=(0.588, 0.588,
0.588, 1.0)`, `specular=(0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 1.0)`, `emissive=(0,0,0,1.0)`) across most layers checked
— evidently a shared engine default rather than per-layer authored data, at least for these
particular avatar/flag materials.

**The exact byte length of the gap between one layer's texture filename and the next layer's name
length isn't confirmed.** It doesn't appear to be a fixed, 4-byte-aligned count in every real file
checked. One real file's last declared layer also had a texture-length field pointing past the
end of the file — plausibly because that sample came from a `patch_upload_temp` (staging) tree
and was itself an incomplete/in-progress export, not necessarily a real format edge case. Rather
than guess at a fixed trailer size, our reader scans forward for the next plausible
length-prefixed ASCII name (the same technique used for `.bsr`'s mesh/material path list) to find
each subsequent layer, and stops gracefully (returning whatever layers parsed successfully) if it
can't — a caller can compare the parsed layer count against the file's declared count to notice.

## Implementation notes

- `server/internal/bmt` (Go): parses the zlib wrapper (via the standard `compress/zlib` package)
  and every layer's confirmed fields; unit tested (`go test`) against a synthetic fixture (never
  real game data, same policy as the other formats).
- `client/scripts/bmt/bmt_reader.gd` (GDScript): the client-side mirror. Notably, it does **not**
  use Godot's built-in `PackedByteArray.decompress(..., FileAccess.COMPRESSION_DEFLATE)` — that
  was confirmed to fail (return 0 bytes) on a real `.bmt` file's zlib stream that a standard zlib
  implementation decodes correctly, evidently a correctness gap in the engine's bundled
  decompressor for some class of otherwise-valid DEFLATE streams. Instead,
  `client/scripts/bmt/inflate.gd` is a from-scratch, standalone RFC 1951 (DEFLATE) decoder
  (stored/fixed-Huffman/dynamic-Huffman blocks), verified against streams produced by Python's
  zlib (an independent, known-correct implementation) and against the real `.bmt` file that
  exposed the engine bug in the first place.
- `client/scripts/assets/object_loader.gd` resolves a material's texture-referencing layer
  against a real `.ddj` file (via `DdjReader`) and applies it as a Godot `StandardMaterial3D`'s
  albedo texture on the corresponding mesh piece — verified end-to-end in
  `object_loader_test.gd` against a full synthetic pk2 archive containing a real
  pk2→bsr→bms→bmt→ddj chain.
