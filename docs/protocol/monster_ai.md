# Monster AI

The state machine every non-player character runs. Recovered whole from
`SR_GameServer.exe`; implemented in `server/internal/ai`.

The engine's own name for the system is **tactics**. Its source file is
`D:\WORK2005\Source\SilkroadOnline\Server\SR_GameServer\AITactics_ExtRoutine.cpp`,
and one surviving log line names most of the vocabulary at once:

	CAIState::OnCSNM_Activate_AI( param : %d, param2 : %d, TacticsID : %d,
	                              AIStateID : %d, RefObjID : %d, pRefTactics : 0x%X )

So: a **tactics** (`TacticsID`) is bound to a monster type (`RefObjID`), and the
monster running it is in an **AI state** (`AIStateID`). Those are the engine's
words, not this project's.

## The sixteen states

Each state is a compiled C++ class deriving from `CAIState`, with its own
vtable. `CAIState::GetStateID` is **vtable slot 1**, and in the base it is
`__purecall` — so every concrete state is obliged to declare an id, and none can
inherit one by accident. Each override is a four- or five-byte function
returning a constant.

| id | class | getter | id | class | getter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `CAIState_SPAWN` | `0x0053dc40` | 8 | `CAIState_HOLDON` | `0x0053e390` |
| 1 | `CAIState_IDLE` | `0x00506380`† | 9 | `CAIState_FOLLOW` | `0x0053e470` |
| 2 | `CAIState_WANDER` | `0x0053de50` | 10 | `CAIState_WATCHOUT` | `0x0053e560` |
| 3 | `CAIState_BATTLE` | `0x0053df30` | 11 | `CAIState_PATROL` | `0x0053e660` |
| 4 | `CAIState_FLEE` | `0x0053e010` | 12 | `CAIState_AUTOCOMMAND` | `0x0053e900` |
| 5 | `CAIState_HOMING` | `0x0053e0f0` | 13 | `CAIState_PICKITEM` | `0x0053e820` |
| 6 | `CAIState_MOVING` | `0x0053e1d0` | 14 | `CAIState_PENDING` | `0x0053e740` |
| 7 | `CAIState_EMOTION` | `0x0053e2b0` | 15 | `CAIState_DEAD` | `0x0053e9e0` |

† **IDLE's getter is COMDAT-folded.** `0x00506380` is `mov ax,0x1; ret`, and
**nine** vtables in the image point at it — it is the compiler's single copy of
"return 1", not a function belonging to IDLE. The evidence for IDLE = 1 is the
**vtable slot**, read at `0x00af899c + 4`, not the function body. Naming that
address after IDLE would have been wrong, and the reference count is what
caught it.

Fifteen of the sixteen getters sit in one contiguous run of the image,
`0x0053dc40`–`0x0053e9e0`, **in id order**. IDLE is the one gap, and IDLE is the
one state whose getter was folded away. Those two facts are independent and they
agree.

`CAISTATE_CUSTOM_SPAWN_SUMMON_SHYTAN` is a seventeenth class but not a
seventeenth state: its slot 1 points at SPAWN's getter, so it reports id 0. It
is a boss-specific SPAWN variant, and it overrides exactly one other slot, 30.

### A third confirmation

`AI::CTactics::ChangeState` (`0x0053ff30`) opens with

	if (id < 0 || 0xf < id) Assert_BreakIfDebugger();

and then indexes a sixteen-element array. The bound, the class count and the
enum all say sixteen.

## The state interface — 48 vtable slots

`CAIState`'s vtable is exactly 48 entries; slot 48 is the null terminator.
Reconstructed from `.rdata` by walking each class's RTTI complete-object
locator, and diffed across all seventeen state vtables.

| slot | what it is | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | destructor | every class overrides it |
| 1 | `GetStateID` | `__purecall` in the base; all 17 override |
| 2 | `OnEnter(a, b) -> int` | **negative refuses the transition** |
| 3 | `OnUpdate() -> int` | negative means the dwell expired |
| 4 | `OnLeave()` | base is `return 0`; only BATTLE, FLEE, PICKITEM override |
| 5 | command dispatcher | a switch forwarding to slots 6–8 and up |
| 6–35 | the command / `OnCSNM_*` surface | 30 slots; only BATTLE and a few others override any |
| 36 | **message dispatcher** | the switch below |
| 37–47 | the eleven message handlers | one slot per message |

### The dwell timer lives in the base

`CAIState::OnEnter` (`0x00558b70`) is three statements:

	this->enteredAt (+0x10) = g_tickMs;     // DAT_00c82620
	this->timeout   (+0x14) = 0;

and `CAIState::OnUpdate` (`0x00558b90`) is one:

	if (timeout != 0 && timeout < (g_tickMs - enteredAt)) return -1;
	return 0;

So a state with no explicit timeout never expires, and every derived
`OnUpdate` that begins `if (CAIState::OnUpdate() < 0)` is asking "has my dwell
run out". **Slot 18 (`0x00559450`) and the head of slot 17 (`0x00559310`) both
set `timeout = (g_tickMs - enteredAt) + 3000`** — 3000 ms is a real literal,
present at both sites, and is the only dwell constant in the machine.

### Known object offsets

| offset | on | what | how known |
|---|---|---|---|
| `+0x04` | `CAIState` | the AI context | used as `this->ctx` everywhere |
| `+0x08` | `CAIState` | cached `AIStateID` | passed as `AIStateID` to the log line |
| `+0x10` | `CAIState` | entered-at tick | written by `OnEnter` |
| `+0x14` | `CAIState` | dwell timeout, ms | read by `OnUpdate` |
| `+0x2c` | AI context | `pRefTactics` | passed as `pRefTactics` to the log line |
| `+0x90` | AI context | the current `CAIState*` | `ChangeState` reads and writes it |
| `+0x00` | `CRefTactics` | `TacticsID` | `*pRefTactics` → the `TacticsID` argument |
| `+0x04` | `CRefTactics` | `RefObjID` | `pRefTactics[1]` → the `RefObjID` argument |

The last two are read straight off the format string's argument list, which is
the strongest kind of evidence this project gets: the engine labelling its own
fields.

## `ChangeState` — the transition, in order

`AI::CTactics::ChangeState` (`0x0053ff30`), state id in `EDI`:

1. **Bounds-assert** `0 <= id <= 0xf`.
2. **If the current state's `GetStateID()` is `0xf` (DEAD), return 0 now** —
   no leave, no enter, nothing touched. A dead monster cannot be transitioned.
3. Clear the context's `+0x148` byte flag.
4. Call the current state's **slot 4** (`OnLeave`).
5. `newState = states[id]`, store it at context `+0x90`.
6. Call the new state's **slot 2** (`OnEnter`). **If it returns negative**,
   take `states[1]` instead, store that, and call its `OnEnter` —
   **ignoring the return value the second time.**

Step 6 is the part worth keeping exactly: element 1 is IDLE, and the refusal
does not propagate. A state that refuses entry does not leave the monster where
it was; it drops the monster into IDLE.

`CAIState_WANDER::OnEnter` (`0x00559df0`) is the clearest refuser — it returns
`-1` when the owner's HP has reached zero.

## The eleven messages

`CAIState::Dispatch` is **vtable slot 36** (`0x005597b0`), a switch over eleven
ids that forwards each to its own slot and asserts on anything else:

	case 0x21: return (*(vtable + 0x94))(a, b);   // slot 37
	case 0x22: return (*(vtable + 0x98))(a, b);   // slot 38
	...
	case 0x2b: return (*(vtable + 0xbc))(a, b);   // slot 47
	default:   Assert_BreakIfDebugger();

A sender always tests the result against **2**:

	if (Dispatch(0x22, 0, 0) == 2) return;

so 2 means "consumed, stop this tick" and 0 means "carry on".

| msg | slot | default handler does | senders |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x21` | 37 | → IDLE | `SPAWN::OnUpdate` |
| `0x22` | 38 | range test, then → **BATTLE** | `EMOTION`, `HOMING`, `WANDER`, `WATCHOUT` |
| `0x23` | 39 | → IDLE (folded) | `BATTLE::OnUpdate`, `FLEE::OnUpdate` |
| `0x24` | 40 | → IDLE (folded) | `FOLLOW`, `HOMING`, `MOVING` |
| `0x25` | 41 | → IDLE (folded) | `AUTOCOMMAND`, `HOMING`, `PICKITEM`, `WANDER` |
| `0x26` | 42 | → **HOMING** | `IDLE::OnEnter`, `WANDER::OnUpdate` |
| `0x27` | 43 | → IDLE (folded) | **no sender in the image** |
| `0x28` | 44 | restores a saved six-field location, then → IDLE | `WANDER` |
| `0x29` | 45 | clears the target; **no transition** | `BATTLE::OnUpdate` |
| `0x2a` | 46 | argument-dependent; → IDLE on argument 1 | `BATTLE`, `EMOTION`, `WANDER` |
| `0x2b` | 47 | → **FOLLOW** when the argument is 0 | `BATTLE`, `EMOTION`, `WANDER` |

**The engine does not name these messages.** There is no string, no log format,
and no enum text anywhere in the image. The names in `server/internal/ai`
(`MsgEnemyInRange`, `MsgReturnHome`, …) are **this project's**, chosen from the
one proven fact about each — the transition its default handler performs. The
ids, the slot mapping and the transitions are the engine's.

Two caveats that are easy to get wrong:

- **`0x5599a0` is folded 89 times across the image.** It is the compiler's
  single copy of `ChangeState(IDLE); return 2`, shared by slots 37, 39, 40, 41
  and 43 *and* by unrelated classes. "→ IDLE (folded)" above means only that the
  slot points at that shared body — it is not evidence about the message's
  meaning.
- Only **two** states override any message slot at all: IDLE overrides slot 41
  and BATTLE overrides slot 44. Everything else uses the base handler.

## The data side — four DB tables

The AI is configured from four tables, and they are **database tables, not
client textdata**. None of the four has a file counterpart in `Media.pk2`;
`docs/protocol/refdata_tables.md` catalogues them among the server's 85 loaders.

| table | loader | class |
|---|---|---|
| `TAB_REFTACTICS` | `0x008334e0` | `CRefTactics` |
| `TAB_REFNEST` | `0x00833750` | `CRefNest` |
| `TAB_REFHIVE` | `0x00833270` | `CRefHive` |
| `TAB_REFAISKILL` | `0x008339c0` | `CRefAISkill` |

Their relationships are stated by the engine's own assert strings:

	Invalid AIRefSkill is bound!! TacticsID[%d] SKILL[%s]
	Invalid Object Hatching Nest checked!! NESTID[%d] Hatching TacticsID[%d]
	Nest Region is invalid!!! NestID[%d] NestRegionID[%d]
	::SpwanNPCAt() can't find tactics!! [CodeName: %s]
	HIVE_MONSTER_SELECT
	NEST_MONSTER_SELECT

So: a **nest** lives in a region and hatches monsters under a **tactics**; a
**hive** groups nests; a tactics binds **AI skills** by codename; and spawning
an NPC fails if no tactics can be found for its codename. (`SpwanNPCAt` is the
engine's own typo.)

Two `CRefTactics` fields are readable from `AI::CTactics::Init`
(vtable slot 15, `0x0053f4d0`):

	mode = refTactics->+0x18;              // a byte, values 0, 1, 2
	if (mode == 2)
	    flag = (refTactics->+0x1c <= rand() % 100);

`+0x18` is a three-valued mode and `+0x1c` is the percentage it rolls against
when the mode is 2. Note the **direction**: the flag is true when the stored
percentage is *less than or equal to* the roll, so a larger stored value makes
the flag *less* likely. That is what the code computes; what the flag means is
not yet read, so it is not named here.

Init also picks a random sign, `+1` or `-1`, into `this+0x59` from
`rand() & 0x80000001`.

**Not recovered: the column layouts.** The four loaders share the same generic
shape as the other 85 and carry the same `0x30` constant that
`docs/protocol/refdata_tables.md` already proved is *not* a record size. Reading
a tactics row field-by-field needs the per-class parse method, which is the next
probe for this system.

## What this gives srrevamp

The server has monster spawns and a combat loop but no AI: monsters do not
wander, chase, give up, or go home. This is the machine that does all four, and
it is now specified precisely enough to implement — sixteen states, a
transition rule with a real fallback, a message interface with proven default
transitions, and one real timing constant.

`server/internal/ai` implements the enum, the message mapping and `ChangeState`
including the two behaviours most likely to be "tidied away" by someone who has
not read the binary: DEAD refusing every transition silently, and the IDLE
fallback ignoring its own `OnEnter` result.

**Not implemented:** the state bodies. Specifying the machine does not specify
what WANDER picks for a destination or how BATTLE chooses a skill; those are
`AI::CTactics`' own 19 slots and the `AI::CAISkill` hierarchy, and they need the
`CRefTactics` columns first.
