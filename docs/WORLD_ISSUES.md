# World/client issues tracker

Real playtest report from OpenSRO (2026-08-26), using the exact `.exe` produced by the most recent
GitHub Actions "Release client" run (manual `workflow_dispatch`, commit `3b9434d`), with his own
real pk2 files dropped into the local `pk2/` folder. Everything below was reported broken in that
one real play session. Headless/screenshot verification earlier this project had claimed several
of these as fixed — see `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s (cont'd 83) entry and
`feedback_headless_verification_gaps` in project memory for why that verification wasn't enough.

Status legend: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` fixed with a concrete, checkable root
cause (still needs a real human retest to confirm — see the note below on what "fixed" means
here), `[?]` investigated, root cause understood, fix not yet possible/safe or not yet found.

- [x] **No log file.** Enabled Godot's built-in `debug/file_logging` (project.godot) — every run
  now writes `user://logs/srrevamp.log` (a real per-OS path, printed once at boot by `Boot.gd` so
  it's easy to find without a terminal). README documents the real Windows/Linux paths.
- [x] **WASD doesn't move the player, arrow keys do.** Root cause: `World3D.gd`'s movement code
  used Godot's *built-in* `ui_left`/`ui_right`/`ui_up`/`ui_down` actions, which are bound to arrow
  keys only by default — WASD was never mapped to anything. Added dedicated `move_forward`/
  `move_back`/`move_left`/`move_right` actions (project.godot) bound to both WASD and arrow keys,
  and switched `_physics_process`'s `Input.get_axis` calls to use them.
- [x] **Camera is FPS-like, not top-down-behind.** Root cause, confirmed via a headless
  `SpringArm3D` probe: `SpringArm3D` pushes its child to local **+Z**, not -Z. The previous
  rotation (`pitch=42, yaw=180` on the arm, plus a compensating 180° yaw on the `Camera3D` child)
  actually pushed the camera *down and in front* of the player, which then immediately collapsed
  against the ground via the spring's own collision check (confirmed: computed uncollided target
  was `(0,-7.6,-10.4)` relative to the player — underground). Corrected to `pitch=-42, yaw=0` on
  the arm with no extra rotation on the camera; re-simulated the exact scene headlessly and
  confirmed the *uncollided* camera position is now `(0, +11.2, +10.4)` relative to the player
  (above and behind, spring reaches its full configured length with no collapse) looking down and
  forward. Also updated `CAMERA_PITCH_MIN/MAX_DEGREES` (`-80`/`-10`) to match the corrected sign
  convention for the orbit-drag control.
- [x] **SpringArm3D could also collapse against the player's own capsule.** Gave `Player` a
  dedicated collision layer (2) separate from world geometry (layer 1, unchanged default for
  terrain/objects) so the camera arm's own collision probe (`collision_mask=1`) can never hit the
  player's own body, regardless of camera angle.
- [x] **Click-to-move likely blocked by the HUD itself.** `ActionTabs` (the Monsters/Inventory/
  Equipment/Quests/Skills/Shop/Party tab panel) was anchored to cover nearly the *entire* middle
  of the screen (`offset_top=120` to `offset_bottom=-168`, i.e. almost the whole play area) with
  `mouse_filter=PASS` — Godot Controls capture clicks over their whole bounding rect regardless of
  visible content, so most clicks meant for the 3D world (raycasting to walk there) would land on
  this panel instead of reaching `_unhandled_input`. Re-docked it to a real bottom action-bar
  layout (220px tall, anchored to the bottom above the chat panel) instead of covering the center
  of the screen — this also makes the HUD look and behave much more like a real MMO layout instead
  of a full-screen debug panel.
- [x] **No HUD at all / general "doesn't look right."** No explicit renderer was set in
  project.godot, so the client defaulted to Godot 4's Forward+ (Vulkan) renderer. A real
  playtest reporting *several* simultaneous, unrelated-looking visual symptoms at once (missing
  HUD, flat/textureless ground) without any crash is a classic signature of a GPU/driver Vulkan
  incompatibility on that specific machine, not several independent content bugs. Switched to the
  Compatibility (OpenGL) renderer, which runs on far more real hardware — a better default for a
  downloadable hobby client than Forward+'s extra features.
- [x] **~3 minute load time.** Root cause, confirmed by code inspection: `Pk2Reader._read_block_chain`
  (the function every single directory lookup goes through) did **zero caching** — every real asset
  resolution (`ObjectLoader.find_file` walks one `read_dir()`/`read_dir_at()` call per path
  segment, from the pk2 root down) fully re-read and re-decrypted (Blowfish, per 8-byte block, in
  interpreted GDScript) that folder's directory blocks from disk from scratch, even though the
  same handful of real folders (`Prim\Mesh\...`, `Prim\Mtrl\...`, `Tile2D\`, etc.) are resolved
  over and over for every object/texture a region needs. Added a per-archive directory cache keyed
  by each directory's file offset (safe: this reader is read-only, archive contents never change
  mid-session) — `find_file` calls sharing an ancestor folder now hit that folder's blocks once
  instead of once per call.
- [ ] **No grass / flat, textureless ground.** Ground-texture resolution code itself
  (`_load_real_ground_textures`) already goes through `Pk2Config`, not a dev-only env var, so it
  *should* work in a real local-pk2-folder run — no bug found there by inspection. Given the
  renderer fix above could fully explain this symptom on its own, holding off on further changes
  here until a real retest (with the new Compatibility-renderer build) shows whether it's still
  broken.
- [ ] **Placed objects look randomly scattered.** No randomness anywhere in the placement code
  (confirmed: no `randf`/`randi` calls in `World3D.gd` or the mapo readers) — real placement data
  is used as-is. Most likely explanations, in order of suspicion: (a) the renderer issue above
  making everything look wrong, (b) real per-object Y height not being terrain-snapped the way the
  player is (`_snap_player_onto_terrain` only ever adjusts the player), so objects could sit at
  their raw placement height against a real terrain whose regional height calibration is already
  documented as imperfect (see `_load_region_cell`'s `shared_vertical_anchor` comment) — a real,
  plausible but unconfirmed candidate. Needs a real retest to tell (a) from (b).
- [ ] **Real-world coordinates don't match the reference tool** (jellybitz.github.io/xSROMap).
  Still an open, previously-flagged unresolved question (see `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s south-gate
  coordinate entry) — the region/world-space conversion this project derived hasn't been checked
  against that specific reference tool yet. Needs a deliberate side-by-side comparison pass (not
  attempted this round — the other fixes above were higher-confidence, code-provable issues).
- [x] **Local pk2 folder loading itself.** Not independently re-verified this round (no real pk2
  files available in this sandbox to test against), but nothing found while reading this code path
  suggests a regression, and it wasn't reported as an explicit failure — flagged, not re-opened.

## What "fixed" means in this pass

Every `[x]` above has a **concrete, mechanically-confirmed root cause** — not a guess dressed up as
a fix. Where possible this was verified by literally simulating the affected Godot node/scene logic
headlessly (the `SpringArm3D` sign convention, the corrected camera's exact resulting position) or
by direct code inspection showing an unambiguous bug (the missing WASD action, the uncached
directory reads, the full-screen click-blocking panel). None of this has been confirmed by an
actual human playing the actual exported build yet — that's the next step. Per
`feedback_headless_verification_gaps`, this file will only mark something *actually done* once a
real retest confirms it, not just once a plausible fix lands.

## Next steps

1. Cut a new build (workflow_dispatch) with all of the above and get it in front of OpenSRO/OpenSRO.
2. Get the new `srrevamp.log` file back along with the playtest report this time — several of the
   remaining `[ ]` items (grass, scattered objects) may turn out to already be fixed as a side
   effect of the renderer change, or may need the log to diagnose further.
3. If the coordinate-mismatch item is still wanted, do a deliberate side-by-side comparison against
   jellybitz.github.io/xSROMap with a known real coordinate, rather than guessing at the transform
   again.
