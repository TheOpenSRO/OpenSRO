# RE completion ledger

**What "100%" means here.** Both binaries are already decompiled in full —
`SR_GameServer.exe` (30,385 functions) and `sro_client.exe` (39,851), 0 failures,
0 skipped, on the RE box at `/var/tmp/decomp_server` and `/var/tmp/decomp_client`
(see `client/tools/ghidra/README.md`). Dumping is done. **This ledger tracks the
part that is not: every game value this project runs on being either recovered
from real data/binary, or honestly disclosed as own design with the reason.**

A line is **GROUNDED** when a real citation exists (data file + column, or a
binary function + offset). It is **DISCLOSED** when it is ours and labelled as
such. It is **OPEN** when nobody has tried hard enough to say which.

Score = GROUNDED / (GROUNDED + OPEN). Disclosed-by-necessity does not count
against completion *if* the reason is proven (the data genuinely does not exist),
which is itself a recovery — quest objectives are the model for that.

## Grounded

| Value | Where it came from |
|---|---|
| EXP curve | `leveldata.txt` col 1 |
| EXP overflow carry, level cap 110, max-level bar | client `FUN_008a97c0` |
| Mastery level-up SP cost | `leveldata` col 2 (server `FUN_0059c4e0` sums `entry+0x10`) |
| Skill damage | skill `'att'` param: percent of weapon damage + flat min–max |
| Skill cooldown / MP cost / learn gating | `_RefSkill` ReuseDelay, Consume_MP, ReqLearn_SP, mastery reqs |
| Monster identity (CodeName, Level, Rarity, Name) | `characterdata` cols 2/57/15/5 + `textdata_object` |
| Monster MaxHP | `characterdata` col 59 (`RefObjChar::ExtractData` → `m_dwMaxHP` at +0x19c) |
| Shop prices | `itemdata` cols 26/31 |
| Item max stack | `itemdata` col 57 |
| Armour/shield defence | `itemdata` cols 63/65-66/74-75/76-77 |
| Potion restore amounts | `itemdata` Param block cols 118/120/122/124 (self-labelling) |
| **Player MaxHP / MaxMP (whole formula)** | `Str×10×1.02^(lvl−1)` / `Int×10×1.02^(lvl−1)` — `GObjPC_InitStats` graph, `.rdata 0x00b462ac`=1000, `0x00b45ea0`=1.02 |
| ParamKeeper ids 0/1/2/3/4 = Level/Str/Int/MaxHP/MaxMP | `GObjPC_InitStats` pushes `charData+0x65/+0x74/+0x76`; `GObjMob_PublishStats` pushes `refobj+0x19c`/`+0x1a0`; and `Stat_ApplyTaggedModifier` maps `'int'`→2, `'hp'`→3, `'mp'`→4 independently |
| **Monster EXP per kill** | `leveldata` col 5 at `min(killerLvl, victimLvl)` — `Formula_MonsterExpReward` (004105d0) reads levelRecord `+0x1c`, result to `GObjPC_GiveExp` (vtable 0x694); `FUN_00631050` grants `entry[0x1c]*n` directly. Column settled by elimination; identical in the ORIGINAL client |
| **Monster `characterdata` cols 75–78** | `'era'`→9, `'bri'`→10, `'hra'`→11, `'cri'`→12 from `Stat_ApplyTaggedModifier`; real data: col 76 = **0** for every monster, cols 75 = 77 = **2·level+25**, col 78 = **2** |
| Stat points per level (3) | real character window |
| Quest identity, chain, descriptions, rewards | `questdata`, `questcontentsdata` cols 3/5-12, `refquestrewarditems` |
| Quest objectives are NOT data | proven absent: no objective refdata class; `_CHARQUEST` is status+count |

## Open — the actual work queue

Ordered by value. Each line names the next concrete probe, so a cold start can
pick one up without re-deriving anything.

1. **Monster combat profile — CLOSED (2026-09-15).** Every term is real now.

   | what | source | values |
   |---|---|---|
   | MaxHP | `characterdata` col 59 | Mangyang 54 … Yeoha 249 |
   | flat absorption | col 71 → param 5 | 7, 12, 22, 103 |
   | reduction % | col 73 → param 7 | = the monster's level |
   | **attack damage** | **col 83 → that skill's `'att'` param** | 17-19 … 67-79 |
   | exp per kill | `leveldata` col 5 at `min(lvl)` | 24 … 12550 |

   **Monster attack was hiding in plain sight because it is not a stat.** No
   column holds it and `GObjMob_PublishStats` never publishes a damage range —
   only `Char_PublishCombatStats` sets params 190/191, and that is the character
   path. A monster attacks with a **skill**: characterdata col 83 is its primary
   attack skill id, and the ids are named after the species itself —
   `160 = MSKILL_CH_MANGNYANG_ATTACK01`, `165 = MSKILL_CH_GYO_ATTACK02`,
   `176 = MSKILL_CH_YEOHA_ATTACK01`. That skill's `'att'` param carries the
   damage, and this project decoded `'att'` months ago for player skills. With
   no weapon to scale, the grounded skill formula collapses to `rand(min, max)`.

   The ranges rise cleanly with level across the whole Jangan ladder (17-19,
   21-23, 25-29, 30-34, 35-40, 41-47, 47-54, 60-70, 67-79), which is
   corroboration rather than the finding — the finding is the skill-id column.

   *Only gold remains disclosed* in a monster's profile.

2. **Combat damage model — the mitigation formula is RECOVERED; the model is
   not yet shipped.** srrevamp still runs `base + bonus - defence, floor 1`, own
   design. The real one is now partly in hand.

   **The unlock was the read side.** Two ticks were lost hunting inlined keeper
   reads (`obj[0x7c+N]`) that collide with every other struct at byte 0x204.
   That was the wrong shape entirely: stats are read through a **virtual at
   vtable offset 0x104 that takes the param id as a literal argument** —
   `(**(code **)(*obj + 0x104))(0xbf)`. So every param read in the binary is
   greppable, with its id visible. 141 read sites. This is the single most
   useful handle found for the stat system and it should be the first thing
   reached for next time.

   **What it produced:**

   - `Formula_RollWeaponDamage` (`0040f8d0`) — the damage roll:
     `rand() % (max-min+1) + min`, with **min = param 191, max = param 190**,
     returning 0 when `max <= min`. `Char_PublishCombatStats` sets 190/191 and
     192/193 as the two types' min/max pairs.
   - `Formula_MitigatePhysicalDamage` (`0040e450`) and
     `Formula_MitigateMagicalDamage` (`0040e830`) — twins, gated on bits 4 and 8
     of the flags at `+0x230`, structurally identical:

     ```
     damage = X / (1 + reduction% / 100) - flatAbsorb        (floored at 0)
     ```

     with **param 7** the reduction percentage on one side and **param 8** on the
     other (`0x00b45ac0` = 1.0, `0x00b45af0` = 100.0). So mitigation is
     *percentage-based with a flat term*, not the flat subtraction srrevamp
     currently uses.

   That also half-answers open item 1: params 5/7 are one damage type and 6/8
   the other, and **param 7/8 is a percentage reduction**. Joined to the column
   map, a monster's cols 73/74 → params 7/8 hold *exactly its level*, so a
   level-10 monster mitigates 10%. Physical-vs-magical rests on the player stat
   graph feeding param 5 from Strength and param 6 from Intellect.

   *Not settled, and why nothing shipped:* which object the formula reads from.
   Both params are read off the same pointer (`param_2`), and until the call
   site in `Combat_ResolveDamage` is resolved it is not proven whether that is
   the attacker or the defender — which decides whether params 5/6 are attack or
   defence. *Next probe:* resolve `Combat_ResolveDamage`'s arguments at its four
   calls to each twin (register-passed — use `ResolveRegArg.java`).

3. **Berserk numbers** (fill 8/hit, 20 s, +50 %) — ours. The mechanic and the
   five orbs are real. *Next probe:* the `'zb'` param tag (0x7a62) in the stat
   vocabulary.
4. **Monster spawn positions** — ours by necessity (`npcpos.txt` has no
   monsters). Likely genuinely absent; prove it and it stops counting as open.
5. **Quest objectives** — proven not to exist as data; any objectives shipped
   must be own design. Closed as a *recovery*, not a gap.
6. **Loot tables** — **CLOSED as a proven absence (2026-09-15).** The mapping
   question was a non-issue: `RefMonsterID` *is* characterdata col 1 (Mangyang
   = 1933), which we already carry. The blocker is the data. The drop classes
   are real in the binary (`CRefMonster_AssignedItemRndDrop`,
   `CRefDropItemGroup`, `CRefDropItemAssign`) but **no drop table exists in any
   artifact this project has** — not in Media.pk2, not in the server's
   `SR_GameRefData/`, nowhere in the y0gi bundle (the only files matching
   "drop" are meshes for the falling-loot visuals). It lives in the server's
   SQL database. So per-monster drops stay own design *by necessity*, and
   become real the moment an operator brings that table — the schema and the
   key are both already in place.
7. **Inventory size (50)**, **unarmed damage (5)** — ours; low value, may be
   genuinely absent.

## Naming coverage, and the denominator

Measured by `SymbolReport.java` (three states: **NAMED** — a real name, from
FID, an assert spelling out `Class::Method`, or applied by hand with evidence;
**ATTRIBUTED** — still `FUN_xxxxxxxx`, but in a namespace derived from a fact the
binary states about itself; **UNKNOWN**) and by `CodeCensus.java`, which
separates game logic from library code.

| | game-logic fns | % of binary | named | attributed | identified | of game logic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SR_GameServer.exe` | 29,554 | 95.6% | 633 | 1,215 | **1,848** | **6.3%** |
| `sro_client.exe` | 36,457 | 91.5% | 681 | 5,293 | **5,974** | **16.4%** |
| **combined** | **66,011** | **93.3%** | 1,314 | 6,508 | **7,822** | **11.8%** |

**The "most of it is CRT and STL" assumption was wrong, and it was measured
rather than argued.** An earlier note in this file said the real denominator
must be far smaller than the 70,773 total because a stripped MSVC binary is
mostly library code. It is not. Across both binaries only **1,368 + 3,394**
functions are clearly not game logic — 368 thunks, 3,461 tiny (<16 bytes), 933
named as CRT/STL by Ghidra's own signature database. Everything else is the
game. So "a full decomp with named functions" is a **~66,000-function problem**,
not the ~6,000-function one that assumption implied.

Two honest caveats on that number, in both directions:

- **Upper bound.** Unnamed STL template instantiations cannot be told from game
  code by any signal here, so some of the 66,011 is library. The `tiny` bucket
  (3,461) is probably mostly STL accessors, and there will be more above 16
  bytes that FID never named.
- **Virtual functions are IN the count, deliberately.** 18,522 game functions
  have no direct caller. An earlier version of the census excluded those as
  dead, which was wrong: a virtual is reached only through a vtable slot and
  Ghidra does not resolve those, so that bucket holds some of the most important
  code in the binary — `GObjPC_GainExpAndLevel`, the exp-gain entry point, is in
  it. It does also hold genuinely dead code, and nothing here separates the two.

Levers used so far, by what they returned: call-graph attribution
(`PropagateModules.java`, +3,131), authored UI string ids
(`LabelFromUIStrings.java`, +140 namespaced and 597 commented), `__FILE__`
asserts (`NamespaceFromSourceFile.java`, 760 seeds), vtable slots
(`VtableAttribute.java`, +68 namespaced and **5,225 annotated**), Ghidra FID
(~930, mostly library), and hand-proven names with citations (~30). The server
is the weaker side at 4.4% and it is where the gameplay lives.

**Levers now exhausted, measured rather than assumed:**

- **Log/assert strings naming `Class::Method`** — 517 server functions reference
  exactly one such string and **13** are still unnamed; the client, 18 and 2. The
  earlier assert-string pass took essentially all of it.
- **Log strings naming a bare `Method()`** — counted 77 unnamed, **worth about
  6**. Reading them rather than trusting the count showed why: the overwhelming
  majority are `"CLAMP() ==> min(%.3f) exceeded max(%.3f) value), File: %s,
  Line: %d"`, a shared assertion macro that says nothing about the function
  containing it — naming those `CLAMP` would be actively wrong. The genuinely
  self-naming remainder is applied (`InitializeGame`,
  `CLobby_RemoveStalePlayers`, `AQ_COSManipulator_DoWork`,
  `RemoveParamKeeperItemEntry`, `AutoReloadMagazine`, `DelItem_EXT`,
  `PC_ReleaseCOS`). Several more were rejected as ambiguous, because the message
  names a function the code *called* rather than itself
  (`"... call DelItem_EXT() returned fail"`); the rule that survives is **take
  the first identifier in the string, and only when nothing precedes it**.
  Lever closed.
- **RTTI class recovery** — impossible, not merely hard. 1,871 type descriptors
  survive and **zero** are referenced, so the COL/vftable chain was stripped.

**The population nothing reaches:** 18,522 game-logic functions have no direct
caller. They are virtuals, and every call-graph lever steps past them.
`VtableAttribute.java` is the answer to that and annotates 5,225 of them with
their table and slot — the fact this project has re-derived by hand four times
(slots 92 exp-gain, 93 SP-adder, 73 GetLevel, 421 GiveExp).

**The levers compound, and that is the main finding of 2026-09-15.** Run once
each they returned little; run as an ordered chain they returned a lot, because
each one's output is the next one's seed. On the server: interpolating 218 gaps
let `PropagateModules` find **175 more** by call-graph unanimity, and the richer
namespace set then let the vtables vote for **149** where they had managed 13
before. Combined identified went 5,055 → **7,822** (7.6% → 11.8%) in a single
chained pass. The order is in `client/tools/ghidra/README.md`; `VtableAttribute`
belongs last and wants re-running after every other lever.

## How to work this file## How to work this file

Pick the top open item, run its next probe against the dumps (grep, don't
re-decompile — see `feedback_re_decomp_first`), and then do one of three things:
move the line to Grounded with its citation, prove the data does not exist and
say so, or record what the probe ruled out and leave the line with a sharper
next probe. **Never** move a line to Grounded on a suggestive curve alone — that
mistake was made twice on characterdata col 79. A use-site is what settles
meaning.

## The trap this file exists to catch

Item 2 (player MaxHP/MaxMP) sat open for three sessions behind a *wrong shape*.
The note here said "find the `FUN_004b3510(0, …)` push that targets them" — and
no such push exists. The base was never pushed at all; it arrives over an edge
of a dependency graph, from Str. Worse, the parameter's identity was invisible
in every one of the 297 decompiled call sites, because it travels in DI, which
Ghidra had not assigned to an argument, and because the callers materialise the
id through chains of LEAs rather than a MOV of a constant — so grep found
nothing and the C read as `SetParam(0, 0, value)` everywhere, complete and
useless.

The lesson is narrow and worth keeping: **when the decompiled C reads cleanly
but says nothing, suspect the calling convention before suspecting the code.**
The fix (`client/tools/ghidra/ResolveRegArg.java`) resolves register arguments
by abstract interpretation and writes them back as comments, so the next dump
carries them. That tool generalises — any callee whose real arguments live in
registers can be recovered the same way.
